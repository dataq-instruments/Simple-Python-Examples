# Python-Example

Examples here demonstrate how to acquire data in both ascii and binary modes

**Prerequisites**:

1) Install Python

2) Install Pyserial and Keyboard (from command prompt if you are using Window)
    - python -m pip install -U pyserial --user
    - python -m pip install -U keyboard --user
    - If you are in Linux, and keyboard is not available, you will have to modify the codes reference to it

3) Firmware 1.35 or higher is recommended https://github.com/dataq-instruments/Firmware_Upgrade. Earlier version of firmware may not work properly in binary mode

4) Understand the protocol, please refer to  https://www.dataq.com/resources/pdfs/misc/Dataq-Instruments-Protocol.pdf

5) Turn 2xxx/1xxx/4xxx (except 2008) into CDC mode: plug the device to USB port, if the LED already blinks Yellow, stop, you are already in CDC mode. If not, once the LED turns blinking Green, push and hold the button immediately (within 5 second time frame), the LED should turn white, hold until LED turns Red, then release the button, now the LED will blink yellow to indicate CDC mode. If you need to exit CDC mode, repeate the same action and a green blinking LED will indicate LibUSB mode.

6) Find out the COM port in use

    - From Windows Device Manager, find out the COM port of the device connected to, and modify the program accordingly<br/>

    - If Linux is used, good chance you will change to CONST_SER_PORT = '/dev/ttyACM0'

**Note**:

1) If you see error message complaining â€œfailed "import serial module" or "seial doesn't have the attribue of serial", You may have multiple installations of Pythons on your PC, if that's case, please unstall all first before reinstall
